### 👨‍💻 About Me
I combine deep operational **expertise** with modern data engineering.

In an era where AI generates code, my value lies in **Physical Grounding**: I understand the physical reality behind the data. I don't just write queries; I build systems that **validate digital data against warehouse reality**.

### The Neurodivergent Advantage
My approach to system architecture is driven by a neurocognitive profile specialized in **rapid pattern recognition** and an intrinsic drive for **logical consistency** ("Just-Right" Precision).

* **Hyper-Pattern Recognition:** I spot anomalies in supply chain data (e.g., "Zombie Data" or impossible lead times) that standard algorithms often miss.
* **System Integrity:** I have a zero-tolerance policy for "Spaghetti Code". I build modular, clean systems to eliminate technical debt before it starts.
* **First Principles Thinking:** I dissect complex problems (from WoW theorycrafting to Supply Chain bottlenecks) down to their core mechanics to find the root cause.
