### 👨‍💻 About Me
I combine deep operational **expertise** with modern analytics engineering.

In an era where AI generates code, my value lies in **Physical Grounding**: I understand the physical reality behind the data. I don't just write queries; I build systems that **validate digital data against warehouse reality**.

### The Neurodivergent Advantage
My approach to system architecture is driven by a neurocognitive profile specialized in **rapid pattern recognition** and an intrinsic drive for **logical consistency** ("Just-Right" Precision).

* **Hyper-Pattern Recognition:** I spot anomalies in supply chain data (e.g., "Zombie Data" or impossible lead times) that standard algorithms often miss.
* **System Integrity:** I have a zero-tolerance policy for "Spaghetti Code". I build modular, clean systems to eliminate technical debt before it starts.
* **First Principles Thinking:** I dissect complex problems (from WoW theorycrafting to Supply Chain bottlenecks) down to their core mechanics to find the root cause.

### Featured Projects

| Project | Domain | Description | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Inventory SQL Pipeline](https://github.com/Monorapture/inventory-sql-pipeline)** | **Analytics Engineering** | A modular ELT architecture acting as the "Single Source of Truth". Calculates stock levels, detects "Zombie Data", and strictly separates cleaning logic from business reporting layers. | `SQL` `Pandas` |
| **[Logistics Python Tools](https://github.com/Monorapture/logistics-python-tools)** | **End-to-End Analytics** | A mono-repo containing my core tools: The **SDR Liability Calculator** (API-based), the **Data Cleaning Pipeline**, and the **Supply Chain Control Tower** (Dashboard). | `Python` `Streamlit` |
| **[Analyst Toolkit Library](https://github.com/Monorapture/logistics-data-utils)** | **Python Library** | My open-source utility library. Follows the **DRY principle** to standardize Excel formatting, database connections, and path handling across all my projects. | `Python` `Automation` |

### Philosophy

> "The Industrial Expert knows *how* the process works. The Data Analyst knows *why* it breaks. I do both."
