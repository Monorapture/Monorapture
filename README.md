### 👨‍💻 About Me
I combine practical operational experience (**Industriemeister Logistik**) with modern data engineering. My background allows me to not just write code, but to understand the *physical reality* behind the data. I specialize in turning "dirty data" into actionable insights and robust architectures.

### 🧠 The Neurodivergent Advantage
My approach to system architecture is driven by a neurocognitive profile specializing in **high-frequency pattern recognition** and an intrinsic drive for **logical consistency** ("Just-Right" Precision).

* **Hyper-Pattern Recognition:** I spot anomalies in supply chain data (e.g., impossible lead times) that standard checks often miss.
* **Bias for Action:** I prefer building prototypes and functional pipelines over endless theory.
* **Data Integrity:** I build systems that enforce clean, consistent data logic to eliminate technical debt.
