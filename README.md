### 👨‍💻 About Me
I combine deep operational leadership experience (**Industriemeister Logistik**) with modern analytics engineering.
In an era where AI generates code, my value lies in **Physical Grounding**: I understand the physical reality behind the data. I don't just write queries; I build architectures that validate if the data matches the warehouse reality.

### 🧠 The Neurodivergent Advantage
My approach to system architecture is driven by a neurocognitive profile specializing in **high-frequency pattern recognition** and an intrinsic drive for **logical consistency** ("Just-Right" Precision).

* **Hyper-Pattern Recognition:** I spot anomalies in supply chain data (e.g., "Zombie Data" or impossible lead times) that standard algorithms often miss.
* **System Integrity:** I have a physical intolerance for "Spaghetti Code". I build modular, clean systems to eliminate technical debt before it starts.
* **First Principles Thinking:** I dissect complex problems (from WoW theorycrafting to Supply Chain bottlenecks) down to their core mechanics to find the true root cause.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

| Project | Type | Description | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Inventory SQL Pipeline](https://github.com/Monorapture/inventory-sql-pipeline)** | **Analytics Engineering** | **UPDATED:** A modular ELT pipeline architecture. Uses SQL Views as an intermediate layer ("Single Source of Truth") to calculate stock levels and detect "Zombie Data". Separates cleaning logic from business reporting. | `SQL` `Pandas` `ELT` |
| **[Logistics Python Tools](https://github.com/Monorapture/logistics-python-tools)** | **Frontend / App** | The analyst's control tower. Includes the **SDR Calculator** (Liability) and **Supply Chain Dashboard**. Demonstrates UI/UX skills for non-technical stakeholders. | `Python` `Streamlit` |
| **[Python Analyst Toolkit](https://github.com/Monorapture/my_python_cheatsheet)** | **Library** | My open-source utility library. Follows the **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself) to automate Excel formatting and DB connections across projects. | `Python` `Automation` |
